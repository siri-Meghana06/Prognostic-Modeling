Iris-Based Health Prediction
A Python-based desktop application that simulates health risk prediction based on iris image analysis. It uses random values for iris features to estimate potential health risks for Heart Disease and Diabetes.

**Features**
Upload iris images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
Simulated extraction of iris features:
Iris Color Intensity
Crypts Density
Collarette Structure
Vessel Tortuosity
Contraction Furrows
Displays risk levels:
Heart Disease Risk (Low, Moderate, High)
Diabetes Risk (Low, Moderate, High)
Real-time analysis simulation with a loading indicator
User-friendly interface using Tkinter and Pillow
Installation & Usage
**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Install dependencies:
pip install pillow
